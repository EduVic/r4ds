-   cross-language

## The NYC taxi dataset

-   how to get the csv files (the pain of big data)
-   show how to convert to parquet
-   something general about the multiple files strategy
-   mention arrow (e.g.) S3 support

## Using dplyr with arrow

-   it's just dplyr
-   collect()
-   things that don't work (yet)

## Using duckdb with arrow

-   show how you can also access via duckdb and dbplyr
-   keep it brief; point is to illustrate using same data source in multiple tools
