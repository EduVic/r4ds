After reading the first two parts of the book, you understand (at least superficially) the most important tools for doing data science.
Now it's time to start diving into the details.
In this part of the book, you'll learn about visualizing data in further depth.

Each chapter addresses one to a few aspects of creating a data visualization.

-   In @sec-layers you will learn about a wide variety of geometric objects you can represent your data with, including some from ggplot2 extension packages.
    You will also learn about statistical transformations you can apply to your data at the time of plotting.

-   In @sec-positioning you'll learn about faceting, position adjustments, and coordinate systems.

-   In @scales you'll learn about how to customize the axis, color, fill, etc. scales of your plot, using both functions from ggplot2 and the scales packages.

-   Finally, in @section-annotations you will learn about theming, zooming, and layout of multiple plots into one.

These chapters focuses on the tools you need to create good graphics.
We assume that you know what you want, and just need to know how to do it.
For that reason, we highly recommend pairing this chapter with a good general visualization book.
We particularly like [*The Truthful Art*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321934075/), by Albert Cairo.
It doesn't teach the mechanics of creating visualizations, but instead focuses on what you need to think about in order to create effective graphics.

### Learning more

The absolute best place to learn more is the ggplot2 book: [*ggplot2: Elegant graphics for data analysis*](https://ggplot2-book.org/).
It goes into much more depth about the underlying theory, and has many more examples of how to combine the individual pieces to solve practical problems.

Another great resource is the ggplot2 extensions gallery <https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/>.
This site lists many of the packages that extend ggplot2 with new geoms and scales.
It's a great place to start if you're trying to do something that seems hard with ggplot2.
