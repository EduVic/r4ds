description: "This book will teach you how to do data science with R: you'll learn how to import your data, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it, and model it. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you'll learn how to clean data and draw plots---and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You'll learn how to leverage the grammar of graphics and literate programming to save time and make your work reproducible. Along the way, you'll also learn how to manage your cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data."
